Stop guessing. Start finding.

Most clipboard managers delete your history after a few days or limit you to a handful of clips. ClipKitty is built for the power user who needs an infinite, searchable archive of everything they've ever copied.

WHY CLIPKITTY?

Unlimited History — No caps, no limits. If you copied it a year ago, it's still there. Text, code, links, colors — nothing expires, nothing gets truncated.

Multi-Line Previews — Stop flying blind with single-line snippets. See full code blocks, emails, and multi-paragraph text in a dedicated preview pane before you paste.

Instant Search — Find any snippet in milliseconds, even across a library of millions. Fuzzy matching means typos don't slow you down. Type "improt" and find "import".

Privacy First — Your data never leaves your Mac. No cloud sync, no analytics, no telemetry. Everything stays on-device, always.

Native & Fast — Built with Swift and Rust, optimized for Apple Silicon. Runs silently in your menu bar with minimal memory and zero CPU when idle.

KEYBOARD-DRIVEN WORKFLOW

Option+Space to summon your history. Arrow keys to browse. Return to paste. Command+1 through 9 to jump. No mouse required.

ClipKitty is the clipboard manager that works as hard as you do.
