Your clipboard history from day one. Searchable in milliseconds.

You copied that command last week. That document yesterday. That address three months ago. Your clipboard manager either forgot it, slowed to a crawl searching for it, or truncated half of it.

ClipKitty stores everything. Advanced fuzzy search means zero lag, whether you're filtering through ten items or ten million. Built for people who copy lots of things and need to find them again.

UNLIMITED HISTORY
Your clipboard history never expires, never truncates, and never hits a cap. ClipKitty stores every item you copy while staying lightweight. Whether it's a code snippet from last week or an address from three months ago, it's there when you need it.

FUZZY SEARCH THAT SCALES
Type "improt" and find "import". ClipKitty uses tantivy, the same search engine infrastructure used in production systems. Results stay instant whether your history holds 100 items or 1,000,000.
