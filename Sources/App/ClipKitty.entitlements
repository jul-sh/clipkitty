    <!-- [HARD-LOCKED] The following capabilities are EXPLICITLY OMITTED to ensure privacy.
         If any of these keys are missing from a 'codesign' audit, the macOS kernel
         physically prevents the app from performing these actions. -->

    <!-- 1. FULL NETWORK BLOCK (Offline Only)
         Missing: com.apple.security.network.client
         Missing: com.apple.security.network.server
         Proof: The app cannot send data to any server or listen for incoming connections. -->

    <!-- 2. FULL FILE SYSTEM ISOLATION (Zero Disk Access)
         Missing: com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write
         Missing: com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write
         Proof: The app has NO access to your documents, downloads, or desktop.
         It is strictly confined to its own container at ~/Library/Containers/com.clipkitty.app -->

    <!-- 3. HARDWARE KILL-SWITCH (No Sensors)
         Missing: com.apple.security.device.camera
         Missing: com.apple.security.device.microphone
         Missing: com.apple.security.personal-information.location
         Proof: The app cannot see you, hear you, or track your movements. -->

    <!-- 4. ANTI-SNOOOPING LOCK (No Cross-App Communication)
         Missing: com.apple.security.automation.apple-events
         Proof: The app cannot "ask" other apps (like Safari or Mail) for data.
         It only knows what you manually copy to the clipboard. -->
