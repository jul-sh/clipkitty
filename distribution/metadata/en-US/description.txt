Most clipboard managers delete your history after a few days or only keep a short history. ClipKitty stores everything and let's you find it instantly.

UNLIMITED HISTORY

INSTANT SEARCH THAT SCALES
Type "dockr push prodction" and find "docker push production". Fuzzy matching works across millions of items without lag. Powered by Tantivy, the same search engine used in production databases.

LIVE PREVIEW PANE
