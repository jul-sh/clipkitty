ClipKitty is a clipboard history manager. Core functionality (storing and browsing clipboard history) works without any special permissions. Selecting an item copies it to the clipboard.

It has no main window — it lives in the macOS menu bar and is activated via a global hotkey.

HOW TO TEST:

1. Launch ClipKitty. A small cat icon appears in the menu bar (top-right of your screen).
2. Copy some text in any app (e.g. select text in Safari, press Cmd+C). Do this 2–3 times with different content.
3. Press Option+Space (the default hotkey) — the clipboard history panel appears centered on screen.
4. Your copied items appear in a scrollable list, most recent first.
5. Use the arrow keys (Up/Down) to navigate items. The right-side preview pane shows full content.
6. Press Return to restore the selected item to the clipboard, then paste it into the previously focused app.
7. Type in the search field at the top to fuzzy-search your entire history (e.g. type "improt" to find "import").
8. Click the filter dropdown (top-left of the panel) to filter by content type: Text, Images, Links, Colors, Files.
9. Press Escape to dismiss the panel.
10. Click the menu bar icon to access Settings (or press Cmd+, when the panel is open).

NOTES:
- The app has no account system, no login, no cloud sync. All data is stored locally.
- On first launch, clipboard history will be empty — you need to copy content to populate it.
