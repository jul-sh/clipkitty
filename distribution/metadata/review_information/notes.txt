ClipKitty is a simple menu-bar clipboard history manager. It saves everything you copy and lets you quickly find and re-use it.

It has no main window — it lives in the macOS menu bar and is activated via a global hotkey.

HOW TO TEST:

1. Launch ClipKitty. A small cat icon appears in the menu bar (top-right of your screen).
2. Copy some text in any app (e.g. select text in Safari, press Cmd+C). Do this 2–3 times with different content.
3. Click the small cat icon in the menu bar.
4. Your copied items appear in a scrollable list, most recent first.
5. Use the arrow keys (Up/Down) to navigate items. The right-side preview pane shows full content.
6. Press Return to copy the selected item to the clipboard. This dismisses the panel.

NOTES:
- The app has no account system, no login, no cloud sync. All data is stored locally.
- On first launch, clipboard history will be empty — you need to copy content to populate it.
